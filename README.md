# Solve Sudoku in tmux

Tested with tmux 3.4 and Ruby 3.2.3 on Ubuntu 24.04.

Try it by replacing some numbers in `sudoku-solved` with spaces, then running:

```console
$ ./tmux.rb sudoku-solved
```

Press q or control-C to stop the program and exit tmux.

I also made a [compiler for tmux](https://github.com/willhbr/tmux-compiler).
